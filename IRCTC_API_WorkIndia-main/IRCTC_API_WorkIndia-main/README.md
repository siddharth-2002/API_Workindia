# IRCTC Railway Management System

## Problem Statement

Hey there, Mr. X. You have been appointed to design a railway management system like IRCTC, where users can come on the platform and check if there are any trains available between two stations. The app will also display how many seats are available between any two stations, and the user can book a seat if the availability is greater than 0 after logging in. Since this has to be real-time and multiple users can book seats simultaneously, your code must be optimized enough to handle large traffic and should not fail while doing any bookings. If more than one user simultaneously tries to book seats, only one of the users should be able to book. Handle such race conditions while booking.

---

This project is a **Railway Management System** designed to simulate key functionalities of the IRCTC system. The system enables train seat bookings, checks for train availability, updates train details, and ensures role-based access for users and admins. The backend is built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MySQL**.

## Features

- User registration and login
- JWT-based authentication for secure access
- Check available trains between source and destination
- Book train seats with race condition handling
- Admin functionalities: add new trains, update seat availability, etc.
- Role-based access (admin/user)
- Error handling and input validation

---

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or later)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) (Database setup)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) (for API testing)

### Environment Variables

You need to create a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following environment variables:

``` bash
PORT=3000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=irctc_db
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
API_KEY=your_admin_api_key
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ujjawalkumar131/IRCTC_API_WorkIndia.git
   cd irctc-railway-management
   ```
   
2. Install all necessary dependencies using npm:
   
   ```bash
    npm install
   ```
4. Set up your MySQL database:
  * Create a MySQL database named irctc_db.
  * Run the SQL scripts in database/schema.sql to create necessary tables (users, trains, bookings).

 Example:
 ``` bash
 CREATE DATABASE irctc_db;
USE irctc_db;

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role ENUM('user', 'admin') DEFAULT 'user',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE trains (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    train_number VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    source VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    destination VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    total_seats INT NOT NULL,
    available_seats INT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE bookings (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    train_id INT,
    seats INT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (train_id) REFERENCES trains(id)
);
```

### Starting the Server
Once the setup is complete, start the server using npm:

```bash
npm start

```
#### Note :- By default, the server will run on port 3000. You can access the API at http://localhost:3000.

    "trainNumber": "123123",
    "source": "Ranchi",
    "destination": "Delhi",
    "totalSeats": 300
  },
  {
    "trainNumber": "124124",
    "source": "Ranchi",
    "destination": "Delhi",
    "totalSeats": 350
  },
  {
    "trainNumber": "125125",
    "source": "Ranchi",
    "destination": "Delhi",
    "totalSeats": 400
  },
  {
    "trainNumber": "126126",
    "source": "Ranchi",
    "destination": "Delhi",
    "totalSeats": 500
  },
  {
    "trainNumber": "127127",
